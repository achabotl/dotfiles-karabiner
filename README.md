# Private settings for Karabiner

Includes:

- "Hyper" key: holding Esc sends CMD + OPT + CTRL + SHIFT
- End sends CTRL + OPTION. That's to have a simpler shortcut to launch applications on the Kinesis keyboard.
- Home sends CMD + OPT: Also to make things easier on the Kinesis.
- "Training wheels" to use the correct shift keys, from [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/)
